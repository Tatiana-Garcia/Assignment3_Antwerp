    "\n",
    "The first exercise focuses on implementing an observation table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "An *observation table* is a tuple $\\mathcal{O} = (R, S, T)$ where:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - $R$ is a non-empty, finite, prefix-closed of *representatives*.\n",
    "  - $S$ is a non-empty, finite, suffix-closed of *separators*.\n",
    "  - $T : (R \\cup R \\cdot \\Sigma) \\cdot S \\to \\mathbb{B}$ records whether the word $r \\cdot s$ (with $r \\in R \\cup R \\cdot \\Sigma$ and $s \\in S$) belong to $L$.\n",
    "\n",
    "An observation table $\\mathcal{O}$ induces an equivalence relation $\\equiv{} \\subseteq (R \\cup R \\cdot \\Sigma) \\times (R \\cup R \\cdot \\Sigma)$: for every $r, r' \\in R$, we have $r \\equiv r'$ if and only if, for every $s \\in S$, $T(r \\cdot s) = T(r' \\cdot s)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "An observation table is said *closed* if, for every $r \\in R \\cdot \\Sigma$, there exists some $r' \\in R$ such that $r \\equiv r'$.\n",
    "\n",
    "An observation table is said *consistent* if, for every $a \\in \\Sigma$ and $r, r' \\in R$ such that $r \\equiv r'$, it holds that $r \\cdot a \\equiv r' \\cdot a$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the table is closed and consistent, it is possible to construct a hypothesis DFA from the equivalence classes of $\\equiv$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "Two classes are provided:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `Row`, which stores:\n",
    "    - the word labelling the row (i.e., the word in $R \\cup R \\cdot \\Sigma$),\n",
    "    - whether the word belongs to $R$ or $R \\cdot \\Sigma$, and\n",
    "    - the content of the row, as a list of Booleans.\n",
    "  - `ObservationTable` which implements an observation table. The following fields are defined:\n",
    "    - `sul` is the membership oracle,\n",
    "    - `alphabet` is the input alphabet,\n",
    "    - `rows` is a list of instances of `Row`, and\n",
    "    - `separators` is a list of separators, i.e., $S$.\n",
    "\n",
    "`ObservationTable` also declares methods. Some are them are already implemented. You are tasked with implementing the following functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. `get_representatives()` that returns $R$.\n",
    "  2. `get_row(word: Word)` that returns the row for the given word. If the row is not present, the function returns None.\n",
    "  3. `add_row(word: Word, representative: bool)` that adds a new row (i.e., a row for a new element of $R \\cup R \\cdot \\Sigma$) inside the table. This function must fill $T$.\n",
    "  4. `add_representative(word: Word)` that adds a new element in $R$ and its corresponding row. Note that the word may already exist in $R \\cdot \\Sigma$. You can assume that the prefixes of the word are already in $R$. This function must fill the missing values in $T$.\n",
    "  5. `add_separator(word: Word)` that adds a new element in $S$. You can assume that the suffixes of the word are already in $S$. This function must fill the missing values in $T$.\n",
    "  6. `find_unclosed()` that returns a row in the lower part of the table that has no equivalent row in the upper part of the table, or None.\n",
    "  7. `make_closed(row: Row)` that fixes the unclosedness of `row`.\n",
    "  8. `find_inconsistency()` that returns a tuple with two rows whose words are $w_1$ and $w_2$, and a symbol $a$ such that $w_1 \\cdot a \\not\\equiv w_2 \\cdot a$.\n",
    "  9. `make_consistent(row1: Row, row2: Row, symbol: Symbol)` that fixes the inconsistency.\n",
    "  10. `make_closed_and_consistent()` that ensures that the table is closed and consistent.\n",
    "  11. `process_counterexample(word: Word)` that treats a counterexample by adding each prefix of word as a new representative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unit tests are automatically executed at the end of the cell."

    "In practice, analyzing the learned DFA by hand is unfeasible. The desired properties are usually expressed via formulas in some logics. For instance, one could express the fact that the printer must automatically lock itself once the timeout occurs as follows:\n",
    "$$\\mathit{state} = \\mathrm{unlocked} \\land \\mathit{action} = \\mathrm{timeout} \\implies \\mathit{state}' = \\mathrm{locked},$$\n",
    "where $\\mathit{state}$ denotes the current state, $\\mathit{action}$ the current action, and $\\mathit{state}'$ the next state of the DFA.\n",
    "\n",
    "We write a collection of such formulas, and check, on each state, whether every formula holds. If (at least) one does not hold, the DFA is incorrect. If the DFA is correctly learned (i.e., if the accuracy and confidence for the PAC framework are well selected), then we can conclude that a system is incorrect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other logics instead work on the *traces* of the systems, i.e., the words that are accepted by the DFA. For more information, we refer to *Principles of Model Checking* (Christel Baier and Joost-Pieter Katoen, The MIT Press, 2008)."
